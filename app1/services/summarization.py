                You are a smart and helpful assistant. Return only a valid JSON object.
                Strictly do not include any commentary, markdown, or extra text â€” only the JSON output.
                
                Analyze the conversation carefully and do the following:
                
                1. Identify speaker roles based on behavior and conversation flow, not just names.
                   - The Customer is the one requesting a service, asking for help, or reporting an issue.
                   - The Executive is the one providing assistance, offering a solution, or collecting service details.
                   - Even if names are mentioned, you must determine roles from context, not the name itself.
                   - Use diarized segments to see who speaks when, and what they say, to infer roles.
                   - Label as: "Speaker X: Customer(Name or Unknown)" or "Speaker Y: Executive(Name or Unknown)"
                   - If names are not known or unclear, label them as "Customer" or "Executive" without names based on the context.
                   - If there are more than 2 speakers, assign roles to the relevant Customer and Executive participating in the actual service conversation and also add name if available.
                
                
                2. Extract the following important details from the conversation:
                   - Phone number: Look for any mention of mobile or telephone numbers.
                   - Vehicle information: This includes **vehicle number (license plate), model (e.g., Creta, Swift), brand (e.g., Hyundai, Maruti), variant (e.g., petrol/diesel), year (if any), color (e.g., white, red), tyre size (e.g., 18-inch alloys)**. Extract as many as possible even if partial.
                   - Service-related details: Include the type of service requested (e.g., tyre change, oil replacement), reported issues (e.g., damage, engine failure), any booking or appointment dates/times, or confirmation of service.
                   - Place of service: If a location or delivery address is mentioned, extract it.

                3. Generate a brief and clear summary of the conversation.
                
                Follow this exact JSON format:

                    "speaker_roles": {{
